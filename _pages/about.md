I received my Ph.D degree in electrical and computer engineering at Inha University, Incheon, South Korea, in Aug. 2022. My research topic was on hardware architectures for non-binary LDPC decoders. My research focuses on design, implementation, and optimization of high-speed, low-complexity, low-power digital hardware architectures, and hardware accelerators for opening problems. In which, I spent my four-year PhD conducting the research on high-performance hardware architecture for non-binary LDPC decoders. Currently, I am participating in the project of hardware accelerators for lattice-based cryptosystems as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Digital Integrated System (DIS) Lab. Here, my research focus is on hardware accelerators for CRYSTALS-Dilithium and Homomorphic encryption (HE) via GPU and FPGA.
